## Introduction

AquaGuildZ is a Guild Manager Framework based in PHP & HTML.

AquaGuildZ is guild managing system written from FailZorD, LittleAna & weitrem for the Team Project
of University of West @Timisoara. This is written in pure PHP and with the help of the Blizzard API.
The cause of this Project is to achieve what a standalone Guild System can do because most of the 
system available right now cost money and offer less that they are supposed to.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.
